arduino installers:
- install files for the arduino IDE
- needed to program devices

excel macro:
- contains the excel macro file to run to plot the .csv data from the device

firmware:
- contains two programs:
	-SetRTC used to set the RTC the first time a new device is programmed
	-Proto2_SLOWSD is the main firmware that the device runs

hardware:
- BOM  : the good, easy to read bom (USE THIS ONE)
- Capstone_46_BOM a more detailed, but harder to read BOM (don't use)

* order parts using the BOM file

- Capstone_46_PCB.zip is the file to send to Omnicircuit to make PCBs

- Capstone_46_PCBA.zip is the file to send to Dorigo to assemble the devices

settings:
- these files should be loaded onto the microSD card used by the device
